        <h2 id="bio">Bio</h2>

        <p>From humble beginnings and now with nearly two decades of customer service experience in the financial industry, I have shifted my career focus to data management. With my years of experience I was fortunate enough to have owned and run a successful business!</p>

        <p>Due to the unfortunate global pandemic caused by Covid-19, thus resultng and affecting many small owned businesses. It was with a sad and heavy heart I had to close the doors to my little business. I was fortunate enough to have landed a role with Kelly Services, and this is where the spark into Software Development began. My former manager assigned me to a project to work with the comapny's Software Engineering team. This opened up a whole new world and thus shifted my focus into technology.</p>

        <p>During my career break (2023), I did self-learning and also did the Data Science Bootcamp with HyperionDev. I decided to go into Data Science, because of my strong knowledge and experience of the financial sector, I felt that this field of study would be best suited here. During my learning journey I thus discovered that Data Science is not just restricted to one sector but it can be applied across all! I am eager to see how far I am able to go in this field and what I can accomplish!</p>
